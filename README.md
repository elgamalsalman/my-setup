# mySetup
My main coding setup, including OS, text editor and configuration files for both.

## Operating System : Arch Linux
My Operating system of choice is Arch. After I do the basic arch setup (partitioning the disk, mounting the filesystem, etc) I run the following commands:
```
pacman -S base-devel grub efibootmng networkmanager git vim firefox 
```

## Text Editors
Let me just make this clear, I lovvveee VIM. So I use it in both competitive programming and all my miscellaneous projects.

### Competitive Programming Text Editor : Vim 
I went for vim not neovim for competitive programming because most onsite competitions (e.g. IOI) don't have neovim installed on the computers, they only have vim, and my vimrc doesn't have any plugins becuase plugins are not allowed in onsite competitions too, so I settled on this:

```

```

Also I tried to make my vimrc as short as possible so that I can quickly type it at the start of any onsite competition.

### Web and App dev Text Editor : Neovim
I told you I love vim. Here's my neovim setup with all the fancy plugins and themes.
